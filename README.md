# PRODIGY_SD_04 â€“ Sudoku Solver

## Task Overview
This project is part of my Prodigy Infotech Internship (Task-04).  
The objective of this task is to create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically using algorithmic logic.

---

## Project Description
The program accepts a 9x9 Sudoku grid as input, where empty cells are represented by 0.  
It then uses a backtracking algorithm to explore possible number placements and find the correct solution to the puzzle.  
Once solved, it displays the completed Sudoku grid neatly in the console.

## Features
- Automatically solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle  
- Uses the efficient Backtracking algorithm  
- Displays the Sudoku grid before and after solving  
- Beginner-friendly and well-commented Python code
